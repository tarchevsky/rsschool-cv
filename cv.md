**Brief Information About Myself**

**Experience**. I started with SEO 8 years ago, realized I was burnt out and didn't want to return to that profession. For some time, I took freelance orders modifying WordPress themes, worked with the Elementor constructor for over a year. I realized that I'm interested in implementing non-standard interactives and that constructors have limitations, so I began studying layout. I started taking larger orders, worked as a subcontractor for a web studio for several years. To speed up development, I wrote my own component library, partly to better understand JS. I long dreamed of working with SPA, and after working on my library, I realized that the combination of component approach + UI + SPA is the coolest thing I've seen, and I want to move as much as possible from layout to frontend logic and slightly free up the backend.

*Recently, I realized that I want to completely get rid of PHP in my life and started intensively studying JavaScript. I want to not only learn frontend but also touch the backend. So I started learning React through Next.js, separating frontend projects with WordPress into WordPress as a headless CMS and Next.js + GraphQL for queries from WP. But I lack knowledge, mainly theoretical, the intricacies of JS. I understand that I can't go to an interview and get a job in a company. I want to resolve this issue for myself and get a job either remotely or in a company as a junior developer.*

**Code example from CodeWars**:

```js
function sumArray(array) {

    if (array) {
        let arr = array,
            sum = 0;

        arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
        arr.shift();
        arr.pop();

        for (const arrEl of arr) {
            sum += arrEl;
        }

        return sum;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}
```

**Goals and priorities**:
* Fill knowledge gaps and become a confident Middle developer.
* Learn to create cool services with authorizations, interactions
* Become a completely autonomous developer and not depend on technologies
* Take on interesting projects and enjoy work
* Interact with other specialists, teach and learn new things

**Strengths**. I love my profession, communicating, grateful for complex tasks and the variability of implementing these tasks, easily change technologies, always looking for something new, a positively lazy person - better to optimize than repeat over and over, love to learn, persistent in problem-solving, open to communication
